# php-foreverdb

This project is a WORK IN PROGRESS!


ForeverDB is a Data-Access-Object (DAO) that only uses INSERTs and is schemaless. 

Its main goals are:

* Prevent data loss, accidental or not
* Provide data retrospection and point-in-time recovery
* Deal with data audit
* Avoid migrations using a fixed (but versatile) schema
